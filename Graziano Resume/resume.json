        "Question" : "Who am I?",
        "Answer" : "I am, at heart, a problem solver. It's easy to see how this led me to software development. I love solving problems with software, whether it involves a simple script to streamline the execution of commands in a terminal or developing a system of analysis to find patterns and trends in stock prices. The latter is the basis of my current personal project."

      {
        "Question" : "What am I looking for?",
        "Answer" : "I am seeking an opportunity to develop easy to use and visually attractive apps and services that help people solve not only problems for which they are seeking a solution, but also problems they did not know they had. "

      {
        "Question" : "Why iOS?",
        "Answer" : "When I bought my first iPhone in 2008, there really weren't many apps that did everything I wanted them to. No matter how good an app was, it always seemed to be missing a feature that I wanted. Always looking to learn new skills, I took the dive into the Apple ecosystem and found that I loved just about every aspect of iOS development."
      },
      {
        "Question" : "More than just programming",
        "Answer" : "Software is only one of my passions. I also enjoy many sports, especially curling, golf, and cycling. I enjoy craft beer and brew my own. Of course, like any other self-respecting geek, I enjoy the occasional videogame."
